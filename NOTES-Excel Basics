## VidÃ©o 1 : Excel 365 Basics #1
Excel does calculations, fomulas (worksheet formulas), And Data Analysis (Like pivot table)
Option + Page Down/Up get you to move frome worksheet to worksheet
Words align to the left, Numbers align to the right, Logicals align are centered and capitalized, Errors are centered
Command + Shift + T = SUM
SUM Errors can come from decimals and can get erased by number formating (like General)
Number formating doesn't change the number, formulas doesn't see number formating.
TAB to go from cell to cell in order so save time/ same as for Return
Crosshair cursor = increment. (Can be called angry rabbit)
Complete Entry and stay in same cell = ^ + Return
SELECT REGION AROUND CELL = Shift + ^ + Space
Hightlight all cells = Shift + click, Highlight selected cells = command + click
Highlight -> Enter a "text" -> Command + Return = same number all over
^ + ; = Actual Date
